# 🧾 Assignment 2 — Test Driven Development

### ✅ Project Progress Checklist

---

## 👥 Group Setup

- [x] Group of 2 (max 3) students formed
- [x] Shared Git repository created (GitHub or GitLab) **Hmon**
- [x] Repo initialized with `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `LICENSE.md`, and `requirements.txt` **Hmon**

---

## 🕹️ Game Selection & Design

- [x] Chosen game:
  - [x] Pig (dice game)
  - [ ] War (card game)
- [x] Reviewed official rules (Wikipedia link)
- [x] Decided variation of the game to implement  
       _One-diced Pig_
- [x] Identified main classes (e.g., Game, Player, Deck, Dice, HighScore, Intelligence, etc.)
- [x] Planned object-oriented structure (class diagram draft)
- [x] Defined core gameplay loop using Python’s `cmd` module **Hmon**
- [x] Discuss public methods of our classes

## 🧱 Code Structure & Best Practices

- [x] Each class in its own file
- [x] Object-oriented design used
- [x] Small, clear methods
- [ ] Follows **PEP 20 (The Zen of Python)**
- [ ] Follows **PEP 8 style guide**
- [ ] Functional programming used where appropriate

- [x] `Makefile` created (optional but recommended) **Dechen**
  - [x] `make run` – run the game
  - [x] `make test` – run tests
  - [x] `make coverage` – generate coverage report
  - [x] `make lint` – run linters
  - [x] `make doc` – generate documentation
  - [x] `make uml` – generate UML diagrams

- [ ] Test invalid input cases
- [ ] Test AI logic
- [ ] Test persistence (high-score saving/loading)
- [ ] README includes instructions to:
  - [ ] Run the test suite
  - [ ] View coverage report

---

## 📚 Documentation

### 1. Code Documentation

- [ ] All classes, methods, and functions have proper **docstrings**

### 2. Auto-generated Documentation

- [ ] Tool chosen (e.g., Sphinx, pdoc, pydoc)
- [ ] HTML documentation generated and stored in `doc/api`
- [ ] Make target `make doc` works
- [ ] README includes instructions to regenerate docs

### 3. UML Diagrams

- [ ] Tool chosen (e.g., pyreverse, PlantUML, UMLet)
- [ ] Generated **class diagram** and **package diagram**
- [ ] Stored under `doc/uml`
- [ ] Make target `make uml` works
- [ ] README includes instructions to regenerate UML diagrams

---

## 🧹 Code Style & Linters

- [ ] Installed and configured:
  - [ ] `pylint`
  - [ ] `flake8`
  - [ ] `flake8-docstrings`
  - [ ] `flake8-polyfill`
- [ ] Lint warnings fixed (not silenced)
- [ ] Passes code style check with `black`, `pylint`, and `flake8`
- [ ] Add target `make lint`

---
